# How to compile and execute

After downloading and unzipping the zip file, run 'make' in terminal. 
This will compile the compiler into an executable. Building Iris requires 
the same environment as MicroC. 

You can run our test suite with `sh runtests`. You can see the output of a 
single test to terminal with `make test file=<FILENAME>`, and can run our demos
with `make demo file=<FILENAME>` (these might require changes to our Makefile 
since the llc variable paths might differ for you).

# How to run test script

Running the test script may require changing the LLC and LLI variables. 
"$(which llc)" was giving us trouble on our local machines.

To run the testing script that runs the test suite, run "sh runtests" in 
terminal. You can also run 'sh runtests tests/$filename$' to run a specific test.
To keep intermediary files, run with the '-k' flag. The default options will 
run our test-hello-world.iris test, which is the only test in the suite right
now.

The test script diffs the output of the program against a golden standard 
provided in the test suite. All golden standard files contain the 
corresponding test name and terminates with '.out' as its name. The test 
script will not successfully compile a test program when it is incorrect.

# What is in the test suite 

NOTE: 
For invalid permitted access, those tests are not under the "fail" tests 
because it is a runtime error, not a compile-time error. Thus, the script will 
check for the correct error message that we put to stdout. This runtime error 
exits the porgram early, so it will not print the 'OK' like the other tests. 
This occurs in test-fail-classvar-permit, test-fail-classvar-assign-permit, and
test-fail-permit-fun.

# What has been implemented

We've implemented classes and related features, such as polymorphism, dynamic 
dispatch of methods in the polymorphic case (e.g. `Animal a = new Dog()` where 
`a` calls a Dog-specific function), the inheritance of member variables and 
functions, overloading of methods by child classes, and `univ` methods. This 
involves semantic checking of methods, inheritance, and public and private 
encapsulation levels, since those can be checked at compile-time. We have also 
implemented runtime checking of permitted functions and member variables to 
disallow non-permitted classes, as, due to the polymorphic case, we cannot do
this at compile-time.

Although they were included in our original proposal, we have not implemented 
Lists. This has been updated in our final Language reference manual.
