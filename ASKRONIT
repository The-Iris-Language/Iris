- Semantically check character/string literals (i.e. '\z' isn't allowed)?
    > should check in scanner parser
- are our testsuite tests sufficient? what constituates a test for a unique feature of our language (ie. classes? encap? inheritance?)
    > the more tests the better, can include testing for class declaration stuff
- is it possible to allow classes to both reference each other (cyclic)
    > check for inheritance cycles but not method cycles -> too complicated
